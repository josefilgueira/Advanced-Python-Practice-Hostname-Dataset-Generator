# 🧠 Advanced Python Practice — Hostname Dataset Generator

This repository contains my solution to the **Advanced Python Programming Practice** from the *Master in Data Science, Big Data & Business Analytics*.  
The goal of the exercise is to demonstrate solid understanding of Python fundamentals and advanced concepts by generating a synthetic dataset of hostnames and performing exploratory analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib.

All requirements and scoring criteria are based on the official assignment document.

---

## 📘 Overview

The task consists of:

1. Generating **random hostnames** according to strict rules (OS, environment, country, incremental node ID).
2. Extracting structured information from each hostname.
3. Building a **Pandas DataFrame** with this structured data.
4. Exporting the dataset to CSV and reloading it.
5. Creating several **Matplotlib visualizations**, including:
   - Bar charts  
   - Horizontal bar charts  
   - Pie charts  
   - A 2x2 subplot grid summarizing the dataset

This notebook was implemented entirely in **Jupyter Notebook**, as required by the assignment.

## 📊 Example Visual Output

The notebook includes:
- 1 grouped bar chart  
- 1 pie chart  
- 3 horizontal bar charts  
- A final 2x2 visualization grid summarizing the dataset  

*(These figures follow the design requirements shown on pages 6–7 of the assignment.)*
